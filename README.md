Advanced Driver Assistance Systems

I decided to build this ADAS information site as i am heavily involved in ADAS as part of my work. After researching ADAS and talking to friends, family and collegues
about it, i realised that very few people actually know what ADAS is or what it can do. 

I thought i would be good to have a simple site that gives an introduction to ADAS, how it can aid the driving experience as well as greatly improve safety and 
in turn save lives. ADAS equipment is quite expensive to have fitted to your car so people need to be aware of benifits before they will spend money on it. 

The site gives an outline of some ADAS features that are avialable for vehicles today and what they do. 

                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            
UX

This is an informative website which should by easy to use for any type of user.

It is laid out in such a way that it is easy to navigate by using the Nav bar or the hyperlinks or buttons built into each page.

The Home page has a large colourful image to attract the user from the second they enter the site followed by a brief outline about the site. Further down the page there is an obvois
button to click which will bring the user directly to the next page where they will get be informed of what ADAS is and a littel background that will allow
the user to link ADAS with more commoin features in cars today. 

At this stage the user will know if the they want to stayon the site or not. there is a link to the examples page in the nav bar and at the bottom of the second page. 

The third page is where the user will lean about some of the different ADAS features found in todays cars. This page is informative without going into too much 
detail and in turn boring the user. Different background colours are used here to keep the users attention. This also makes the page more visually pleasing.

The next page is a contact page with simple form that the user can input thier name and email address to recieve information on the latest tech in cars.
The contact page can be accessed from any page on the site by using the nav bar or the subtle contact button in the footer.
There is also more space on this page if the develper wanted to add links to social media pages or blogs. 

The final page just give some brief informat obout me and why i decide to build the site. 

The home page can also be accessed from any other page on the site by clickig the home button in the footer. 

                            --------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            
Features

As this is is a basic informative website there are not many interactive features. 

As part of the user experience though  there are multible buttons/ links to click that will redirect the user to different parts of the site. 

The main user feature is the form which will allow the user to sign up to recieve further information about updates. 

There is however endless opertunities to implemtent more interactive features to the site which i would like to do in the future. 

such examples include:

 - Embedded videos of different adas features and how they work 
 - Videos of adas that has been tested and comparison videos of ADAS features from different vehicle manufactures
 - Links and Downloads to different studies that may have been carried out on ADAS
 - Links to vehicle manufacturers websites to find out what each VM has to offer. 
 - A section specifically for new cars.

Technologies Used:

Bootstrap :  "https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/"

 - I used Bootstrap for my nvigatin bar aswell as the layout by using the container class and rows. An example of where bootstrap is used is the form. 

Google Fonts:   "https://fonts.google.com/" 

 - Google fonts was use to style the fonts used throughout the website.

W3schools:  "https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp"

 - I used W3 schools at various stages of the project to help me implent different features such as the media queries and the hover function. 

                            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            

Testing:


Every feature works as it should.

Each button and hyperlink in the website is clickable and redirects the user to the intended page or area on the site. 

The form works as it should and will not let the user submit without having a correct email address entered. 

The media queries also work as the should - for example the large picture on the home page will resize as the screen decreases in size. 


                                ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                                

Deployment:


This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

                                ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Acknowledgements:

The first group i wish to acknowledge is code institute for having a wonderfully layed out course which is easy to followed
and learn from. 

The ideas for the website came from my work with cartell.ie who have been very accomidating while i do the course. 

I got great inspiration from the Irish site ADAS.ie

The IT team at work who have gave me advice when needed just the creatin of the website.
