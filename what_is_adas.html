                <h1>What is ADAS</h1>

                <p>
                    ADAS ia an abbriviation for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. ADAS is an evolution of older safety systems that are now standard features in most cars today such as ABS, Cruise Control, Parking Sensors and Automatic lights. Mercedes Benz first introduced
                    ABS in 1978 but it wasnâ€™t until 2004 that it became mandatory for a vehicles the be fitted with ABS. Much the same will happen with ADAS. So far just a handful of vehicles are fitted with ADAS but as the years move on and technology
                    advances more and more of these Advanced Driver Assistance Systems will become standard equipment in cars.
