                            <h2>Adaptive Cruise Control <i class="fas fa-tachometer-alt" style="color:green;"></i></h2>
                            <p>
                                Adaptive Cruise Contol is a more advanced version of regular cruise control you find in most cars today. Have you ever been driving along a motorway with your cruise control active when suddendy you realise you are very quickly getting to close to the
                                vehicle travelling ahead of you? Well, Adaptive Cruise control can help to prevent this!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Adaptive Cruise Control systems usally use a radar sensor at the front of the vehicle to monitor the traffic situation ahead. The system will set a distance between the vehicle and the vehicle infront and keep that distance by braking and accelerating
                                as nessessary. When paired with an automatic transmission Adaptive Cruise Control can even bring the car to a complete stop and take off again.

                        <p>
                            There are multible levels or tiers of Lane Assist systems. But what do they do? Well, as the name suggests, they help you to stay in lane as you drive. The most basic Lane Assist system is a Lane Departure Warning. This is where the vehicle uses a camera
                            positioned in the windscreen to monitor the road markings ahead. If the vehicle senses that you are going to unintentially cross the line the system can alert the driver. This may be an audible or visible warning or in some
                            cases the steering wheel may gently vibrate.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            More advanced Lane Assist Systems can apply gentle steering force as a vehicle drifts out of lane therefore activly keeping it in lane, and there are some systems that can actually keep the vehicle in the center of the lane.

                        <h2>Light Assist <i class="fas fa-lightbulb" style="color:yellow;"></i></h2>
                        <p>
                            Similarly to Lane Assist there are different levels or tiers to lighting assistance in cars. The most basic form of light assist is just automatic lights. Using a dusk sesor, the vehicle will automatically switch on the dipped headlights. Moving on from
                            this there is a system called High Beam Assist. A small forward facing camera can detect oncoming vehicles at night and can automatically dip the high beam lights for the driver. This allows the driver to concentrate more on
                            steering the car.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another form of Light Assist are adaptive lights. Adaptive lights can swivel and direct the beam in the driection a car is turning. This makes cornering at night much safer and gives the driver far better visibility. The most advanced form of light asssit
                            avaible at the moment is what is commenly known as Matrix Lights. Using a cluster of LED bulbs the matrix light system can turn on and off individual bulbs. This means that the driver can drive continuesly with the high beam
                            on, as the Matrix Lights can black out different areas such as other oncoming vehicles.

                        <p>
                            As the name suggests, Blind Spot Monitoring systems monitor the blind spots around your vehicle. These blind spot monitors usually include a light built into the wing mirror of the vehicle. As another vehicle approaches from behind and enters the blind
                            spot, the light in the wing mirror will illuminate to alert the driver to the vehicle in the blind spot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Blind Spot monitors can also help drivers reversing out of a parking spot by monitoring a wider area behind the car. Some more advanced systems work in conjunction with lane assist systems and can help steer the car out of the path of a vehicle approching
                            from behind.

                        <p>
                            Autonomous Emergency Braking systems (AEB) are possibly the most important ADAS systems availble today. AEB can vary across different makes and models of vehicles. Usually they are powered by a radar sensor located at the front of the vehicle, although
                            some are powered by camera systems or Lidar sensors. When first introduced, AEB systems worked at low speeds. They work by monitoring the traffic ahead and if the system predicts that a collision may happen, they can first
                            alert the driver and if this warning is ignored, they may automatically apply the brakes. They can help mitigate or even avoid a collision completely. As the technology became more advanced, so did the systems. Todays AEB systems
                            can work up to motorway speeds and even recognise potential collisions with pedestrians and cyclists.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            AEB is becoming a standard feature in more and more vehicles today, and eventually will be fitted to every vehicle.
